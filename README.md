# Car consumption prediction using ML

Prediction of the consumption (in liters per 100km) of a car.

"Automobile Data Set" from the UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile).
  - The msising values have (manually) been replaced with -69 to ease the replacement in the code
  - The 'mpg' column which reports the consumption in MPG (miles per gallon) has been converted to 'mpgl' which reports the consumption in L/100km (liters per 100 kilometers)
